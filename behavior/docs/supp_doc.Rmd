## Task Directions and Questions

### Standard directions

You are about to read a series of short, fictitious criminal cases. After
reading the accusation against the defendant, view additional
information by clicking each of the three grey buttons and holding for
as long as you want to read.

For example, clicking on the button labeled \"Physical Evidence\" would
show any physical evidence that had been found in the case. You may
click and read the facts in each box as many times as you like.

After reading the entire story and the additional information, reflect
on how you feel about the facts in the case as it is presented. Please
do not be concerned about making a legal judgment, especially with
regard to the rules of evidence or the law, but rather merely consider
your personal opinions and intuitions about the case.Â 

You will then be asked about the strength of the case against the
accused and the amount of punishment that type of crime deserves.

For each question, move the slider to the position that best reflects
your personal judgment.

When you are finished, click the Submit button to go to the next
question.

### Explicit/curative directions

You are about to read a series of short descriptions of fictitious
criminal cases. After reading the accusation against the defendant, view
additional information by clicking and holding down the mouse button
over each of the four grey boxes.

For example, clicking on the button labeled \"Physical Evidence\" would
show any physical evidence that had been found in the case. You may
click and read the facts in each box as many times as you like.

After reading the entire story, reflect on how you feel about the facts
in the case as it is presented. Do not be concerned about making a legal
judgment. Rather, think about your personal opinions and intuitions
about the case.

You will then be asked two questions.

First, how strong is the case against the person who was accused of the
crime? How confident are you, based on the evidence that you read, that
the accused actually did it? Is the evidence in the case strong or weak?
Do not let your feelings about the seriousness or awfulness of the crime
sway your judgment about whether that person actually committed the
crime.

The second question is the opposite. Setting aside whether you think the
accused committed the crime, how severely should anyone who commits a
crime like this be punished? Is it a horrible and heinous crime,
deserving of life in prison without parole? Or is it not serious, and
should be punished very lightly, if at all? When choosing the amount of
punishment, think only about the kind of crime that the accused is
accused of, not whether he or she actually did it.

For both questions, move the slider to the position that best reflects
your personal judgment. When you are finished, click the Submit button
to go to the next question.

### Questions

**Case Strength** (C): How strong is the case that the accused committed this
crime?

Slider: Very weak, Very strong

**Punishment** (P): How severe should the punishment be for someone who
commits a crime like this one?

Slider: No punishment, Life in prison without parole

## Multiple Rating Model
For the case in which subjects provide multiple ratings (punishment, case strength, etc.) for a given scenario, we model the resulting
vector of ratings, $R_r$, $r=1\ldots N_r$, similarly:

\begin{align}
  R_i &\sim \left[\mathcal{N}(\theta_i, \sigma^2_{r(i)})\right]^{100}_0 \label{rating_m}\\
  \theta_i &= X_{i \,\cdot} \cdot \beta_{s(i) c(i) \,\cdot \,r(i)} \label{theta_m}\\
  \beta_{s c p r} &= \mu_{p,r} + \gamma_{c p r} + \epsilon_{s p r} \label{beta_m}\\
  \gamma_{c p \,\cdot} &\sim \mathcal{T}_{\nu}(0, \Sigma_p) \label{gamma_m}\\
  \epsilon_{s p r} &\sim \mathcal{T}_{\nu'}(0, \tau^2{p r}) \label{epsilon_m}\\
  \Sigma_p &= L_p \mathrm{diag}(\eta_p) L_p^\top \\
  \Omega_p &= L_p L_p^\top &\sim \mathrm{LKJ}(1) \label{L_m}\\
  \mu_{p r} &\sim \mathcal{N}(50, 50) \label{mu_m} \\
  \eta_{p r} &\sim \mathrm{Ca}^+(0, 50) \\
  \tau_{p r} &\sim \mathrm{Ca}^+(0, 50) \\
  \sigma_r &\sim \mathrm{Ca}^+(0, 5) \\
  \nu, \nu' &\sim \mathcal{N}^+(0, 100) \label{nu_m}
\end{align}

Here, we have used a "long" or "melted" representation of $R$ in which each index $i$ corresponds to a single observation of a
single rating scale $r(i)$. This allows us to more easily handle missing data in the model fitting procedure (see below). 
The model is almost equivalent to concatenating $N_r$ versions of the first model, one for each rating, 
aside from two key differences: First (\ref{gamma_m}) and (\ref{L_m}) involve a multivariate t-distribution on the population 
effects specific to 
each case ($\gamma$). That is, we allow for covariance among the ratings for each effect at the population level, where the magnitudes of the 
variances are again controlled by $\eta$ and the correlations $\Omega = LL^\top$ are modeled according to the LKJ distribution [@Lewandowski2009-tm]
through their Cholesky factorization (\ref{L_m}).\footnote{Implemented as \texttt{L \textasciitilde{} lkj\_corr\_chol(1)} in Stan.}
Second, in order to more accurately estimate variances in the presence of missing data, we have restricted this model to a single
value of $\tau$ across all cases (for each outcome and regressor) (\ref{beta_m}).

## Model Fitting
We calculated posterior distributions and credible intervals for each variable of interest using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
as implemented in the Stan probabilistic programming language [@carpenter2016stan]. Full code for all analyses is available at 
[https://github.com/pearsonlab/legal](https://github.com/pearsonlab/legal). Models were fit by running 4 chains of either 1000 samples (case strength only model) with a thinning fraction of 1 or 2000
samples (multiple outcome models) with a thinning fraction of 2. For both models, the first half of samples were discarded as burn-in. This resulted 
in 2000 total samples for each variable, for which we report means as well as 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (bounded 
by the 2.5% and 97.5% samples from the distribution). We assessed convergence via effective sample size and the
Gelman-Rubin statistic, for which all runs had $\hat{R} < 1.1$ [@gelman2014bayesian].
